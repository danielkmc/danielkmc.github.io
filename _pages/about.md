Hi! I'm a recent graduate from [UT Austin](https://utexas.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics. 

I'm currently looking for a new position as a software engineer primarily in distributed computing systems and high performance computing. 

In my free time, I enjoy honing my tennis striking and taking time to explore whatever city I'm in on my bike. I also enjoy listening to podcasts that help explain the complexities of society and the hidden influence of money, some of my favorites being [`Freakonomics`](https://freakonomics.com/), [`Planet Money`](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money), [`More Perfect`](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect), and [`Hidden Brain`](https://hiddenbrain.org/).

If you think I'm a good fit for your role or just want to connect, feel free to contact me through my [`email`](mailto:danielmc4102@gmail.com) or connect on [`LinkedIn`](https://linkedin.com/in/danielkmc/)!

<!-- 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
